This is a repo mainly about statistic topics or algorithms and their implementation. I created this repo because I've learnt some algorithms implemented in R, but I personally prefer Python. 

Python packages/libraries used in this report:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- matplotlib
- SciPy

Topics that have been introduced:
- [Python] Linear regressions
